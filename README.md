# Wine and Dine

## Description 


Our group was challenged to create a website using two server-side APIs, so we decided to come together and create a site that brings you some yummy meals! Drinks included ðŸ˜‰ 


## Usage

![In the upper left is a logo that says 'Wine and Dine' and to the upper right are links that say 'Home, Food, Drinks, and Contact'. Below it you see a blurb that explains what the site does and below it there is a search bar that you put ingredients in.](winedine-screenshot.jpg)

To use Wine and Dine, input a main ingredient into the search bar (i.e. chicken, beef, asparagus, etc) and you'll immediately be greeted with 
three random meals. Each meal comes with a list of ingredients and directions on how to make it. 

We also created a random drink function. Most of us have our main go-to cocktails, so we decided to spice things up and make it completely random so you can try something new! To do so, click the 'Random Drink' button and you'll find an image of the cocktail, its ingredients and how to make it. If you want to save the drink recipe for later, you can click our 'Save Drink' button and access it in the future.
